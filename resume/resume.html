                        Within Itau I had the opportunity to work in the sales area of ​​the Bussines app.
                        My job consisted of writing and evolving the app's pages, as well as creating tests and being
                        responsible for the entire code upload process.
                        During my time I had the opportunity to not only develop and evolve the team pod and creating
                        the sales lounge but also to evolve the entire sales system within the hole app's flows
                        One of my biggest challenges was migrating the sales system for a new sdk, which provided many
                        challenges because in addition to being a new logic, it was something that involved almost every
                        flow of the app.
                        I also participated in the module migration project that my team was responsible for from MVC to
                        MVVM-C

                    The Apple Developer Academy | Mackenzie is a project of the Faculty of Computing and Informatics at
                    Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie, in collaboration with Apple, with the aim of training
                    developers on the different Apple platforms (iOS, TVOS and WatchOS). During 24 months, students are
                    trained for development considering not only application programming, but also design and usability,
                    as well as strategies for commercial development.”
                    Within the project I had the possibility to work on the entire development flow from ideation,
                    design, ux, programming, upload and even project presentation.
                    This taught me and gave me a much deeper understanding of the process of creating an app and opened
                    my mind to all other phases of development outside of programming.
