        <p>Hello! I’m a Brazilian tech enthusiast with a passion for creating intuitive and impactful user experiences. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and have spent the last six years honing my skills at renowned companies like Google, Itaú, and Apple. My diverse experience has equipped me with a unique blend of technical expertise and design thinking, allowing me to approach challenges from multiple perspectives.</p>
        <p>Recently, I made the exciting move to Canada to pursue my studies in User Experience (UX) at SAIT. I’m eager to dive deeper into the world of design, blending my background in technology with user-centered principles to craft solutions that resonate with people.</p>
        <p>When I’m not immersed in design or coding, you can find me exploring the outdoors, experimenting with new recipes, or enjoying a good book. I’m thrilled to connect and share ideas with like-minded individuals in the UX community!</p>
